Cydippe sent the oxen **into the fields.**
  
They did not return **with her sons.**
  
**At that time**, the festival was due to begin.
  
Cydippe was **not able to go** to the festival.
  
Cleops and Bitias **wanted to bring** their mother to the festival.
  
They yoked **themselves** to a wagon.
  
They pulled the wagon **for many hours.**

When Cydippe was brought to the festival **by her sons**, all the onlookers were amazed.

Cydippe asked the gods to grant **to her and to her sons** the best gift possible for mortals.

**That night**, they fell asleep and never woke up.
