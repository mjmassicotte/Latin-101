Cydippe sent the oxen into the fields.
They did not return with her sons.
At that time, the festival was due to begin.
Cydippe was not able to go to the festival.
Cleops and Bitias wanted to bring their mother to the festival.
They yoked themselves to a wagon.
They pulled the wagon for many hours.
When Cydippe was brought to the festival by her sons, all the onlookers were amazed.
Cydippe asked the gods to grant to her and to her sons the best gift possible for mortals.
That night, they fell asleep and never woke up.
