A regular Latin verb has 4 principle parts. 
The first and thrid principle parts are finite verb forms. First person singular is used for these principle parts.
The third priciple part of interficiō is identical to prefixing inter- to the third principle part of faciō. The other principle parts of faciō maintain the use of an a, whereas in the third principle part, the a changes to an i. The first two principle parts of interficiō makes use of an i after the f and the last two are changed to an e after the f. 
Venīre and audīre. Their principle parts are regular because each consecutive principle part changes in the same way, using the same endings for each different principle part. 
The verbs capiō and faciō both end in -iō. The second principle parts which are infinitive both end in -ĕre, making them the third conjugation. The third principle parts which are first person singular in the perfect active indicative both end in -ī and their a's chanhge to e's. The fourth principle parts which are participle both end in -tus.
