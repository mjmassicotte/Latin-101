**Please remember that the final result should be a single, coordinated  paragraph.**

Your first sentence should express that Cydippe sent the oxen into the fields, but they (the oxen) did not return in time. Use the preposition ad with 
tempus, temporis n. to express “in time.”
**Cydippe bouis❌ in agris❌ ❓ *verb?*, sed illi non reddidīt❌ ad temporibus❌.

Your next sentence should express that the rituals were supposed to be performed at that time, and the priestess was supposed to be present at the temple,
but Cydippe was not able to set out on the journey. You can use a distinctive Latin idiom to express the idea of “setting out on a journey”: literally, 
the phrase means “give yourself over to travel”, and uses verb do with the reflexive pronouns and the prepositional phrase in uiam.

**ille tempuo❌ duci sacra debebant, sec sacerdos adfuit❌ ad fanum debebant, sec Cydippe non poterat dedit❌ via. 


Next, express that Cleops and Bitias wanted to bring their mother to the temple, so they yoked harnessed themselves to a wagon. Latin says this as 
“They harnessed themselves beneath the yoke.”
**Cleops et Bitias wanted❓ matrem ab tempore uoluit. ei iugo sibi iunxit.

Next, tell us that they pulled their mother Cydippe in the wagon for many hours. Cydippe is a Greek name: use Cydippen for her accusative singular form.
**multus horus❌, ei Cydippen egit in plaustris❌.


Your next sentence should express that on account of this great deed, Cydippe prayed to the gods.
**propter ❓, Cydippe deos precabatur.

Next, relate that that night, the exhausted sons rested, and never awoke.
**illiam nocti, fessus filii acquieuit, et numquam surrexit. ❌

Finally, express the conclusion that Hyginus attributes to Cydippe: “To die is the best gift for mortals.” Use an infinitive as the subject of the 
sentence (just like the English phrase, “To die is…”).
**mori optimum est pro❌ mortalibus**
