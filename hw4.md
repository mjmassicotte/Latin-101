What are the three genders of Latin nouns?
**masculine, feminine, and neuter**
What are the three pieces of information in a Latin dictionary entry for a noun?
**The first part tells you its nominative singular form, the second part is its genitive singular form, and the gender(s), usually abbreviated m, f, or n.**
How do you figure out what declension a noun belongs to?
**You look at the endings of its genetive singular**

**the genetive case**
What case does Latin use to name the subject of a verb?
